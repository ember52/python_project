This is a Python script that implements a simple contact book application. The application allows users to create, update, and delete contacts.

The code imports two modules: datetime and csv. The datetime module is used to get the current date and time, while the csv module is used to read and write CSV files.

The code defines the following functions:

    1-user_selection(): This function prompts the user to select an action they want to perform (create, update or delete a contact). Depending on the user's choice, this function calls the appropriate function (user_input(), user_update() or user_delete()).

    2-restart_app(): This function prompts the user to restart the app or exit. If the user chooses to restart the app, the user_selection() function is called again.

    3-import_original_data(): This function reads data from the original CSV file and saves it to a new CSV file with the current date and time in the file name.

    4-export_updated_data(): This function reads data from the current CSV file and saves it to the original CSV file.

    5-user_input(): This function prompts the user to enter contact information (name, email, phone number, and address), and saves the information to the current CSV file.

    6-save_inputs(): This function saves the new contact data to the current CSV file.

    7-user_update(): This function prompts the user to select a contact field(name, email, phone number or address) they want to update, and then prompts them to enter the new value for the selected field. The function then updates the contact information with the new value in the current CSV file.

    8-user_delete(): This function prompts the user to enter the email of the contact they want to delete. The function then deletes the contact from the current CSV file.

Finally, the main function is called, which starts the app by calling the user_selection() function.

Overall, this code provides a simple command-line interface for managing a contact book. The user can create, update, and delete contacts, and the changes are saved to a CSV file.
